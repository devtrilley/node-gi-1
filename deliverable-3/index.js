/*
Deliverable 3: Hosted Weather App 

Code-along to create Andrew Mead’s weather application.

Allow the user to choose their unit for temperature reporting.

Style the pages to be aesthetically pleasing and to follow typical site conventions (e.g. where should a navbar be?).

Host your site. 

Push the code necessary to spin up your application to a repository called “Hosted Weather App.”

Add your hosted URL to the repository. It does not matter which platform you use to host.
